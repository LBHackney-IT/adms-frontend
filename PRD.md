# Product Requirements Document: Apprenticeship Data Management System (ADMS) - Frontend

## 1. Introduction and Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for the frontend of the Apprenticeship Data Management System (ADMS). The frontend will be a modern, user-friendly interface for the Apprenticeship Department to manage apprentice and financial data.

**Problem Statement:** The Apprenticeship Department currently relies on a manual, spreadsheet-based system for managing apprentice and financial data. This process is inefficient, prone to errors, leads to data inconsistencies, and is limited by a one-year data export cap. This creates a significant administrative burden and prevents effective long-term data analysis. The backend for this system has been developed, and a frontend is now required to interact with it.

**Proposed Solution:** This project will build a robust, intuitive, and secure frontend application to serve as the primary interface for the ADMS. The application will be developed using Next.js with React Server Components and TypeScript to optimize security and performance. It will provide a modern and accessible user interface (UI) for all data operations, including uploading, viewing, editing, and deleting apprentice and financial records. The frontend will also be responsible for converting user-uploaded CSV files into JSON format before sending them to the backend API.

## 2. Stakeholders and Target Audience

*   **Stakeholders:** Apprenticeship Team Members.
*   **Target User:** The primary users are **Apprenticeship Team Members**. They require a reliable and efficient system to manage apprentice records, track financial transactions, and respond to inquiries without the manual effort of cross-referencing multiple spreadsheets.

## 3. Goals and Success Metrics

### Business/Product Goals:
*   Provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for all data management tasks.
*   Significantly reduce the manual effort and time required for data entry, reconciliation, and reporting.
*   Improve data accuracy and consistency through a centralized and validated data entry point.
*   Ensure a secure and performant user experience.

### Success Metrics (KPIs):
*   A quantifiable reduction in the time and manual effort expended by staff on data entry and reconciliation tasks.
*   A significant and measurable decrease in data errors compared to the legacy system.
*   High satisfaction from the Apprenticeship Team Members.
*   Fast page load times and responsive UI interactions.

## 4. User Stories

*   **US1:** As an apprenticeship team member, I want to retrieve specific apprentice information swiftly to respond to inquiries efficiently.
*   **US2:** As an apprenticeship team member, I want to extract a comprehensive list of all currently active apprentices so that I can generate requisite reports.
*   **US3:** As an apprenticeship team member, I want to bulk-upload apprentice data from a CSV file, so that the system can automatically add new apprentice records and update existing ones.
*   **US4:** As an apprenticeship team member, I want to bulk-upload financial transaction data from a CSV file, so that new transactions are systematically added.
*   **US5:** As an apprenticeship team member, I need the ability to view, add, edit, and delete individual apprentice records through a user interface to perform ad-hoc data corrections.
*   **US6:** As an apprenticeship team member, I want to be able to search, filter, view, add, edit, and delete individual financial transaction records through the UI, so that our financial data can be managed with precision.
*   **US7:** As an apprenticeship team member, I need access to activity logs for all data ingestion events so that I can monitor data flow and effectively troubleshoot any emergent issues.

## 5. Functional Requirements

*   **FR1: CSV to JSON Conversion:** The frontend shall provide an interface for users to upload CSV files. The application must then convert the CSV data into a JSON array of objects before sending it to the backend API.
*   **FR2: Data Validation:** The frontend shall perform minor data sanitization and type-checking on the converted JSON data before sending it to the backend. This includes ensuring required fields are present and that data types are generally correct (e.g., numbers are numbers, dates are in a valid format).
*   **FR3: Apprentice Data Management:** The frontend shall provide a user interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on apprentice records.
*   **FR4: Financial Transaction Management:** The frontend shall provide a user interface to perform CRUD operations on financial transaction records.
*   **FR5: Data Querying and Filtering:** The frontend shall provide a user interface for querying and filtering both apprentice and transaction data based on various criteria (e.g., status, date, program).
*   **FR6: Activity Log Viewer:** The frontend shall provide a user interface for viewing activity logs related to data ingestion events.
*   **FR7: User Authentication:** The frontend shall handle user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated "apprenticeship team members" can access and modify data.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The application should be fast and responsive, with optimized page loads and minimal latency for UI interactions. The use of Next.js with React Server Components will be crucial in achieving this.
*   **Security:** All communication with the backend API must be secure. The frontend should not expose any sensitive information, and all data modification operations must be restricted to authenticated users.
*   **Usability:** The UI should be intuitive, easy to use, and modern in its design. It should follow accessibility best practices, prioritizing screen reader and keyboard navigation.
*   **Reliability:** The application should be highly available and include robust error handling to prevent data loss and provide clear feedback to the user in case of errors.

## 7. Design and UI/UX

*   **UI/UX:** The UI should be clean, modern, and easy to use. The team will leverage shadcn/ui and TypeScript, which utilizes Radix components, to expedite development and ensure a high level of accessibility. This will include a focus on screen reader compatibility and tab-based navigation.
*   **Data Tables:** The application will feature data tables for displaying apprentice and transaction records. These tables should be sortable, filterable, and searchable.
*   **Forms:** Forms for creating and editing records should be user-friendly and provide clear validation messages.

## 8. Technical Considerations

*   **Frontend Stack:** The frontend will be developed using Next.js 13+, React Server Components, and TypeScript.
*   **UI Components:** The UI will be built using shadcn/ui, which is based on Radix UI components.
*   **CSV Conversion:** A library such as `csv-parser` or `papaparse` will be used to handle the conversion of CSV files to JSON.
*   **State Management:** For client-side state, a combination of React's built-in state management (e.g., `useState`, `useReducer`) and potentially a lightweight state management library will be used as needed.

## 9. Assumptions, Constraints, and Dependencies

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   The backend API is fully functional and available.
    *   The backend API documentation is up-to-date and accurate.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   The solution must be built using the specified technology stack (Next.js, React Server Components, TypeScript, shadcn/ui).
    *   The frontend is responsible for the CSV to JSON conversion.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   The frontend is dependent on the backend API for all data operations.
    *   The frontend is dependent on the availability and stability of the third-party libraries used (e.g., shadcn/ui, csv-parser).

## 10. Risk Assessment

*   **Technical Risks:**
    *   **Risk:** The CSV to JSON conversion logic could have bugs, leading to data corruption or ingestion failures.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests specifically covering the CSV conversion logic.
*   **Dependency Risks:**
    *   **Risk:** The backend API may have issues that block frontend development.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use tools like Postman or Swagger to test the API endpoints independently of the frontend client. Establish a clear data contract (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger) between the frontend and backend.
*   **UI/UX Risks:**
    *   **Risk:** The UI may not be intuitive or user-friendly for the target audience.
    *   **Mitigation:** Conduct user feedback sessions with the Apprenticeship Team Members throughout the development process.
